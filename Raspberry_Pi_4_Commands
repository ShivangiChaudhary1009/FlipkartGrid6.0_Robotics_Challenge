How to control the Camera Module via the command line:

#Now your Camera Module is connected and the software is enabled, try out the command line tools rpicam-still and rpicam-vid.


#Open a terminal window by clicking the black monitor icon in the taskbar:



#Type in the following command to take a still picture and save it to the Desktop:
rpicam-still -o ~/Desktop/image.jpg

#Press Enter to run the command.
#When the command runs, you can see the camera preview open before a still picture is taken.


#Look for the picture file icon on the Desktop, and double-click the file icon to open the picture.

#By adding different options, you can set the size and look of the image the rpicam-still command takes.


#Add --width and --height to change the dimensions of the image:
rpicam-still -o ~/Desktop/image-small.jpg --width 640 --height 480

#Now record a video with the Camera Module by using the following rpicam-vid command:
rpicam-vid -o ~/Desktop/video.mp4
